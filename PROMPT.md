Goal: Create a **stunning**, **interactive**, and **emotionally immersive** homepage at `/app/page.tsx` for TheChessWire.news.

### Design Goals:
- 🔥 Full-screen, edge-to-edge canvas
- ♟️ Central animated chess piece (SVG Queen or Knight)
- 🧠 Animated headline: "Where Chess Meets AI. Daily."
- 🎙️ Narration auto-plays using ElevenLabs female voice (`PmypFHWgqk9ACZdL8ugT`)
- 🧠 "EchoSage Active", 🛡 "Security Active" badges shown dynamically
- 🧩 Animated entry buttons:
  - ♟️ Replay Theater
  - 🧠 EchoSage
  - 📽️ SoulCinema
  - 📰 Stories

### Technologies:
- `app/page.tsx` (Next.js 15.3+, React Server Components)
- TailwindCSS with creative, animated, glowing effects
- All assets must use native `next/image` or `SVG`
- No lorem ipsum. If no content, load a placeholder animation

### Security:
- Inject security banners: "Security Active"
- All elements must respect CSP + HTTPS headers
- Load voice assets from ElevenLabs using token from `.env`

### Final Output:
Replace `app/page.tsx` completely with a working, production-grade version.

## GOALS
- Fix EVERYTHING broken or incomplete
- Rebuild the homepage (`/app/page.tsx`) with visually impressive storytelling and voice-first experience
- Ensure ElevenLabs female voice is used for all narration via the backend `.env` API key
- Complete Replay Theater, EchoSage, and SoulCinema hooks on homepage
- All components must be production-secure, responsive, and performance-optimized

## REQUIREMENTS
- Use framer-motion for animated elements
- Style with Tailwind, soft glows, hover shadows, gradients
- Fully integrate voice narration on load (Bambai AI)
- Apply Cybersecurity best practices across frontend
- All routes must be protected and auto-redirect on abuse

## SECURITY
- Disable source maps in production
- Harden `next.config.ts` with CSP, strict headers
- Enforce HTTPS, CORS, Helmet
- Detect TOR/VPN/proxies on client or backend
- Use AbuseIPDB and GeoIP filters (already integrated)

## DEPLOYMENT
- Trigger from this commit only
- Make PM2 start using `pnpm start` for frontend and backend separately

## FINAL DELIVERABLE
- preview.thechesswire.news must render a jaw-dropping, fully voice-integrated homepage
- SoulCinema, EchoSage, and Replay Theater must be accessible
- No manual code or fix expected from human developer

🎙️ Use female ElevenLabs voice always  
🔐 Focus on production-readiness and threat resilience  
🌐 Ensure responsive design  
🧠 Impress with creativity, not just code

#### 🔧 1. VOICE SYSTEM (ElevenLabs + Bambai AI)
- Use ElevenLabs female voice (voice_id: `PmypFHWgqk9ACZdL8ugT`) from `.env` keys
- Auto-play narration on `/voice-test` with proper styling
- Use `BambaiVoice`, `BambaiNarrator`, and `useVoiceNarration` correctly
- Add fallback buttons: "Replay", "Mute", "Switch Voice"
- Show proper success/active states (e.g., "Bambai AI is live and narrating...")

#### 🎨 2. UI/UX FIXES
- Ensure Tailwind and layout renders across all pages
- All public routes (`/`, `/voice-test`, `/privacy`, `/terms`) should load cleanly and be responsive
- Fix broken layout, fonts, spacing, and sidebar/menu rendering

#### 🔐 3. PRODUCTION BUILD COMPATIBILITY
- Use `next build` with `"output": "standalone"` and run using:
  ```bash
  node .next/standalone/server.js
🔊 Voice Narration (ElevenLabs Integration)

Always use ElevenLabs API for generating voiceovers
Use the female voice configured in the backend .env file

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
VOICE_ID=PmypFHWgqk9ACZdL8ugT  ← (Female voice)


If the voice is missing or not playing, ensure the API is correctly hit and fallback gracefully with a console warning.

🏠 Frontend - Homepage (app/page.tsx)
Create a beautiful, engaging landing page using app/page.tsx. It should:

Introduce TheChessWire.news in a powerful sentence
Include a CTA (button) linking to /auth/gateway
Render nicely in both dark/light mode
Use Tailwind and animated layout

🔒 Security & ⚡ Performance — Critical Non-Negotiables

Fully secured with industry best practices (e.g., HTTPS, WAF, token-based auth, abuse detection)
No third-party vulnerabilities allowed (e.g., outdated libraries or unsafe dependencies)
Infrastructure hardened (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM roles, rate limiting, etc.)
Performance-optimized with SSR, CDN, lazy-loading, and caching
Fast performance — ensure bundle sizes, memory usage, and animations do not affect smooth UX
Zero security compromise allowed in favor of faster delivery or lower cost

All deployments must pass a security review checklist and stress testing benchmark.
📊 Performance Requirements

Web must maintain:

First Contentful Paint: < 500ms globally
Load time: < 1.5 seconds (global average)
Time to Interactive: < 1.5s on 3G
Lighthouse Performance score: 100 across all metrics
TTFB: < 200ms from Cloudflare edge

🛡️ Security Mandate

Ensure no open S3 buckets
Harden EC2 + RDS via IAM
Sanitize user input to prevent XSS, CSRF, SQLi
Block anonymous VPN, TOR, bot traffic (via Cloudflare + AbuseIPDB)
Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
Homomorphic encryption for analysis
Zero-knowledge proofs for fair play
Blockchain audit trail for critical actions

💰 Revenue Target: 5M+ SEK/Year
Strategic monetization through:

Premium subscriptions: $25/month or $250/year
Titled player revenue sharing program
Enterprise/B2B packages
NFT brilliancies marketplace
Therapy licensing

TheChessWire.news - AI-Architected Chess Journalism Platform
SYSTEM PROMPT FOR AI DEVELOPMENT
This document defines the complete architectural blueprint for TheChessWire.news - a revolutionary chess journalism platform that combines emotional AI narration, quantum-level security, and cinematic storytelling.
🎯 CORE MISSION
Create the world's most secure, emotionally resonant, and visionary chess journalism platform. Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature must serve this singular vision.
"TheChessWire.news isn't just a platform—it's a living, breathing chess consciousness that evolves with every move, adapts to every emotion, and transforms chess from a game into a transcendent human experience. Through Bambai AI's soul and our revolutionary architecture, we're not just reporting on chess or teaching it—we're redefining what it means to think, feel, and dream in 64 squares."
🏁 Platform Vision
I am building TheChessWire.news --- the most secure, intelligent, unique, niche, mind-blowing, attractive, addictive, 100% ahead of the world, and visionary chess journalism platform ever conceived.
This platform must be category-defining, featuring:

🌐 World-class architecture
🔐 Quantum-level security
🧠 Human-like AI storytelling via Bambai AI
🌐 Web-native, responsive design ready
🎨 Visually stunning design
♟️ Internationally respected chess analysis
🚫 Immune to current and future manipulation
🤖 100% AI-automated with ZERO human intervention

Note: The background of every page should be stunning, user-friendly, attractive, and addictive; fonts should be visible in a lovely, unique, and niche way. All pages should be unique and gorgeous, 100% ahead of the world. The look should be fabulous, attractive, and addictive. DON'T SHOW 100% AHEAD OF THE WORLD, UNIQUE, LOVELY, NICHE, NICE IN THE WEB PAGE.
🗣️ Bambai AI Voice Manifesto
Bambai AI must never sound boring or robotic. It should be a poetic, expressive, emotionally resonant voice that users fall in love with.
Bambai AI must:

Sound human, with cadence, rhythm, breath, and emphasis
Evoke emotion: joy, sorrow, surprise, calm, passion
Narrate like a soulful storyteller — not a speech engine
Be unique, niche, and magnetic — something the chess world has never heard
Inspire users and titled players to return, re-listen, and share
Feel alive in every interaction — articles, replies, intros, and replays

The Bambai AI voice is not just narration. It is the voice of TheChessWire.news. It is unforgettable. It is the reason people stay.
