# TheChessWire.news - AI-Architected Chess Journalism Platform

**SYSTEM PROMPT FOR AI DEVELOPMENT**

This document defines the complete architectural blueprint for TheChessWire.news - a revolutionary chess journalism platform that combines emotional AI narration, quantum-level security, and cinematic storytelling.

## 🎯 CORE MISSION

Create the world's most secure, emotionally resonant, and visionary chess journalism platform. Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature must serve this singular vision.

## 🏁 Platform Vision
I am building TheChessWire.news --- the most secure, intelligent, unique, niche, mind-blowing, attractive, addictive, 100% ahead of the world, and visionary chess journalism platform ever conceived.
This platform must be category-defining, featuring:
🌐 World-class architecture
🔐 Quantum-level security
🧠 Human-like AI storytelling via Bambai AI 
📱 Mobile-native, Web/Android/iOS ready 
🎨 Visually stunning design 
♟️ Internationally respected chess analysis 
🚫 Immune to current and future manipulation

Core Requirement: All videos should be 100% automated without human intervention. They should also be uploaded to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and other social media with excellent, unique, and niche content to get maximum subscriptions, likes, and views. The content should be attractive and addictive so that users watch our videos repeatedly.
Performance Goal: I don't want you to implement the entire module immediately. Based on the complete module list, I want you to intelligently recommend which modules should be implemented on which pages or routes --- in a way that maximizes performance and avoids code overload. Prioritize page-level mapping, user experience, and lazy loading where possible. The goal is to keep the platform ultra-performant, modular, and scalable.

From now on, ensure that all modules and features are implemented with the following principles:

1. 🔍 **Page-Level Module Mapping**:
   - Automatically detect which modules belong on which pages or routes.
   - Ensure UI/UX is not overloaded by distributing modules smartly.
   - Avoid performance issues by placing code only where needed.

2. 🧠 **Ultra-Detailed Code Output**:
   - Match or exceed Claude-level detail.
   - Full working code blocks (not partial).
   - Inline comments for clarity.
   - TypeScript types and structure.
   - Validations and edge-case handling.
   - Security-first approach: abuse filtering, encryption, rate-limiting.

3. 🔁 **No Redundant Repeats**:
   - If logic already exists elsewhere, reference or extend it — do not duplicate.

4. 🚀 **Production-Ready by Default**:
   - Code must be scalable, modular, and optimized for AWS deployment.
   - Avoid placeholder text like “your_code_here”. Implement real logic.
   - No assumptions — always ensure working imports, functional handlers, and error control.

5. 🔗 **Platform-Aware**:
   - All code, pages, and modules must integrate with the style and standards of TheChessWire.news.
   - Ensure the tone, voice, and user experience are unique, niche, and world-class.

6. 🎯 **Goal-Oriented**:
   - Prioritize performance, security, and automation.
   - Final outcome must be stable, scalable, and require zero human intervention after setup.

✅ Once this prompt is active, ChatGPT will fully take over architectural mapping, implementation, placement, and optimization — no further Claude interaction is required.

🔥 Infrastructure & Deployment
ALL CODE MUST BE AWS-DEPLOYMENT READY:
✅ AWS RDS PostgreSQL 
✅ Node.js + TypeScript 
✅ Next.js App Router or Express APIs 
❌ No Vercel serverless 
❌ No Supabase or edge functions
🔐 MANDATORY ENCRYPTION ARCHITECTURE (Module 287)
TheChessWire.news follows a FULLY ENCRYPTED, ZERO-TRUST architecture across ALL modules. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE for GDPR compliance and quantum-level security.
