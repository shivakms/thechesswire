## 🚀 What Is This?

> A world-first: chess journalism fused with cinematic storytelling, zero-trust security, and poetic AI narration.

Built from scratch using a deeply structured AI prompt, TheChessWire.news delivers:

- 🎙️ Voice-first articles, replays, and PGN-based documentaries  
- 🔐 Quantum-level cybersecurity architecture (OWASP + AbuseIPDB + IP logic)  
- 🧠 Memory-aware modules that respond emotionally  
- ♟️ Emotional PGN replays with Stockfish + narration  
- 🧩 Modular AWS-only backend (no Vercel, no Supabase)  

This is not a blog. This is the future of chess storytelling.

## 🧠 AI-Architected Vision

This project was architected entirely using AI — guided by an advanced prompt (`PROMPT.md`) that defines every module, security policy, UX constraint, voice system, and deployment guideline.

🧠 Read the full system spec: [PROMPT.md](./PROMPT.md)

All future contributors (human or AI) must adhere to its architectural and philosophical rules.
